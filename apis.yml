  Orbital is a data gateway and integration platform that connects APIs,
  databases, event streams, and other data sources without requiring glue code
  or manual integration maintenance. The platform delivers self-repairing
  integrations through instant, on-the-fly orchestration that automatically
  adapts as APIs and schemas evolve, eliminating the need to write resolvers,
  generate API clients, or maintain YAML mapping files. Orbital works by having
  users embed semantic type metadata tags directly in their API specs (OpenAPI,
  Protobuf, databases), then use those tags in queries written in TaxiLang, a
  powerful query language that lets consumers define the schema they want while
  Orbital figures out where to fetch data from across multiple sources. Key
  features include universal scriptable field-level authorization policies
  applied everywhere, an automatic API and data catalog with interactive
  diagrams, end-to-end observability with lineage and call traces, and the
  ability to deploy custom APIs, event streams, and batch workflows in minutes
  with instant caching for performance. The platform supports git-based
  deployments where a simple git push instantly deploys endpoints that
  automatically migrate as APIs evolve, and enables use cases like microservices
  orchestration, event-based architectures, and rapid onboarding of external
  data feeds, making it ideal for engineering teams that would normally have to
  write extensive integration code.
